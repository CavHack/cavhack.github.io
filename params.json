{"name":"DALi: an agnostic boltzmann NLP for Affective Computing.","tagline":"DALi - Directed Acyclic Linked Itelligence","body":"### Welcome to CavHack's DALi Manifesto.\r\nWith the advent of today's 'NoStack-Information-Universe', Modern A.I Libraries require to scrape, parse, encode, and infer intent, from Sparse and sometimes un-related information (i.e: geolocation coordinates, time of activity, session duration, and even text-message HSL). DALi is built with Clojure/Smalltalk and aims to integrate all of Today's most in-vogue Machine Learning libraries, into a functional, portable, and context-agnostic probabilistic NLP. What makes us different from others is our passion for Graph Topology and Abstract mathematics, the binding of the collective unconscious and the human condition. DALi is fairly nascent, but expanding stochastically.\r\n\r\n### About the Author\r\nCavHack has been a programmer for almost 15 years, and at the ripe age of 27, he discovered a connection between discrete analysis and Riemann geometry via Category Theory. Since then, CavHack has funded Venire Labs Inc (Lewes, DE; Miami, Fl; Austin,TX; San Francisco, CA) which is a multi-disciplinary conglomerate. Venire is focused today on improving research and development, in the promising fields of Console-Agnostic Mobile Game Development, Multi-Player A.I, and IP Nanotechnology. \r\n\r\nThe connection between the non-linear aspects of our daily life and that of our deterministic- almost unfathomably accurate counterpart: the microprocessor, is a heartfelt marriage between disparate quantum states of our reality: CavHack aims to bring forth this new Alchemy of sorts, tying butterfly wings of information, and condensing these as the essence of human condition in binary form.\r\n\r\n### About DALi\r\nDALi stands for Directed-Acyclic-Linked-Intelligence and provides an efficient Open-Source API written with the functional programmer in mind. DALi utilizes Clojure which exposes our algorithms to the Java Virtual Environment. There we can communicate with clusterized agents via Apache Storm. Clojure is inspired by the Torch library, which has become the staple of today's Machine Learning archetypes. By focusing on KISS principles, DALi is powerful enough to distribute tasks a long a variety of containers; employing today's best-practices with Docker.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
